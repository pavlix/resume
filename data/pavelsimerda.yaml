    Freelance software developer. Rust and Haskell enthusiast. Working
    with embedded operating systems and network devices. Astounded by eBPF
    debugging and performance profiling in Linux. Training anyone from
    young children to seasoned developers.

    I am working with companies that understand the value of safe
    programming in embedded systems. Let us explore together the value of
    static typing and compilation into machine code and look at real-time
    and parallel computing.
