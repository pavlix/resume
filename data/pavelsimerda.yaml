summary:
    - |
        Software developer enjoying *operating systems* engineering,
        integration and testing. I am currently focused on the *Linux kernel*
        internals and instrumentation. I help software developers to keep
        maximum control over their systems. I use *C* and *Rust* as
        system-level programming languages and *perf*, *ftrace* and *eBPF* as
        instrumentation tools.

        I help children and beginners to start with software development
        using *Scratch* and *Python*. I'm using *Pandas* for data analysis tasks
        and would like to explore *Julia* programming language. I'm working
        with *PostgreSQL* database and replication.
