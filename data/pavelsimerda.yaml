summary: | 
    Software developer enjoying embedded *operating systems* development
    and network devices. I'm invested in *Linux* but any innovation is
    also welcome. I'm a *C* programmer with *Python* experience also
    interested in *Rust*, modern *C++* and *Julia*.

    In the *Linux* environment I work with *eBPF* for various purposes from
    network to kernel-level orchestration and latency tracking. I'm
    interested in concurrent and real-time applications.

    Apart from that I teach *mathematics* and *computer science* to anyone
    from beginners to university students. I use *Scratch* and other modern
    tools for the purpose.
