summary: |
    Freelance software developer. Rust and Haskell enthusiast.  Working
    with embedded operating systems and network devices. Astounded by eBPF
    debugging and performance profiling in Linux. Training anyone from
    young children to senior developers.

    In the upcoming years I am going to work with embedded software
    companies that understand the value of safe programming and consider
    switching from C and C++ to Rust. At the same time I can still provide
    support for C and C++ developers as I did before.
experience:
    - position: Freelance Developer & Consultant

          I've been through different roles and projects before I found my
          niche. Finally I fell in love with programming languages that
          translate to machine code and with operating systems code. The
          “year of change” somewhat accelerated my transition.

          My personal goal was to fix various NetworkManager design flaws
          and make it usable in server environment as well as in
          development and network engineering setups. At that time I met
          network developers from SUSE and learned about wicked, their
          alternative to NetworkManager and invited them to cooperate.

          I started web development as a volunteer webmaster of the school
          website. Soon I started working with young entrepreneurs as well
          as former students. I was an active innovator since the beginning
          of my career. I introduced Python, PostgreSQL, Subversion and
          later Git to my co-workers and participated in product
          architecture discussions.

    - position: Mathematics and CS Tutor
      description: |
          At times my friends struggled to grasp mathematical and logical
          concepts in various subjects at school. Later it became part of
          my business to tutor everyone from young children to pensioners.
